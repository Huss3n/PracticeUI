# Practice UI
## Popular Apps UI Showcase using SwiftUI
This repository contains a collection of popular app UIs built using SwiftUI. The purpose of this project is to practice and perfect SwiftUI skills by recreating the user interfaces of well-known apps.

## Completed Apps:
### Spotify
- A replica of the <a href="https://github.com/Huss3n/PracticeUI/tree/main/PracticeUI/PracticeUI/Spotify"> Spotify</a> app interface, showcasing various UI components and interactions commonly found in music streaming applications.
- Data is fetched from DummyJSON to use as placeholder content during development and prototyping.

## Features:
- Dynamic Content: Utilize DummyJSON to generate mock data for realistic UI representation.
- Reusable Components: Implement SwiftUI components in a modular manner to ensure reusability and maintainability.
- Interactive UI: Emphasize user interactions through animations and gestures to enhance the user experience.

## Future Plans:
- Expand the collection by adding more popular apps UIs.
- Integrate real data sources to create fully functional prototypes.
- Optimize code structure and architecture for scalability.
